# Mini-cybertruck

This project involed myself making a mini foamboard cyber truck that was driven by 4 motors on a acrylic chassis

Power was supplied by a 3S lipo battery for the motors and a 5v portable battery bank for the Raspberry Pi 3b

Motors were controlled by 2 L293D Motor drivers allowing for motor to have it's own control

A Raspberry Pi 3b was used to control the motordriver using GPIO and to revice input from Playstation 4 controller
